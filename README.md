# Object_Detection_system

Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects in images or video streams. Using YOLOv5 with PyTorch, you can achieve fast and accurate real-time object detection on live video feeds, such as those from webcams or CCTV cameras. YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once, version 5) is a state-of-the-art object detection model developed by Ultralytics and is widely used for its speed and ease of implementation.

Overview of Real-Time Object Detection
YOLOv5:
YOLOv5 is an advanced deep learning model designed for detecting objects in a single pass.
It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes, object confidence scores, and class probabilities for each grid cell.
Pre-trained weights (yolov5s.pt, yolov5m.pt, etc.) are available for immediate use.

PyTorch:
PyTorch is the deep learning framework used to load and run YOLOv5.
It enables GPU acceleration for real-time processing.

Real-Time Processing:
Real-time detection involves capturing frames from a video source (e.g., a webcam) and processing them sequentially using the YOLOv5 model.
